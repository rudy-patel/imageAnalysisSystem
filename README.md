# Low-Footprint Image Analysis System
This system is a low-footprint versatile system involving hardware and software developments for recognition of objects and/or faces through machine learning algorithms.

### Development environment
To run the `dev` server:

On **macOS**:
1. Navigate to the project directory in terminal
2. Create a virtual environment using: `python3 -m venv env`
3. Run `source env/bin/activate`. This will start the Python virtual environment.
4. Make sure your dependencies are up to date by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. In the environment, run `python3 main.py` to run the server in the `main.py` file.
6. Go to the port specified in the output
7. To stop the environment, run `deactivate`

On **Windows**:
1. Navigate to the project directory in terminal
2. Create a virtual environment using: `python3 -m venv env`
3. Run `.\env\Scripts\activate`. This will start the Python virtual environment.
4. Update pip in the virtual environment by running the following command: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
5. Make sure your dependencies are up to date by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. In the environment, run `python3 main.py` to run the server in the `main.py` file.
7. Go to the port specified in the output
8. To stop the environment, run `deactivate`

You're all set. From now on, you just need to start from **step 3** to run your dev environment.
